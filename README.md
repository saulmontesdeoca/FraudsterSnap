## 📚 Description
FraudsterSnap is an app that uses ML to predict fraud in online transactions.

It works by an innovative prediction model which helps the user on the transactions that happens day to day in order to detect frauds on the account. All the computing is done on the cloud through an API and showed in the app built on React. 

## 🦾 Training 

The model is trained under several machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest-Neighbours and Ranom Forest in order to see which one is more efficient given the Dataset used.  

The second model, if time lets us, is going to be an automatic way on 

The dataset used comes from Kaggle and can be found in [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/overview)

## 🚀 Expected functionality

The main functionality of the app is to be a valuable asset in client transactions such that online transaction frauds can be predicted, avoided, and mitigated.
The app will get a transaction input it will process it using Machine Learning. It will return these fraud-predictions as binary outcomes that tells us if the transaction has a probable fraud or not.
